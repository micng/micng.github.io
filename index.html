    - Greetings, comrades! In Shadow Lab, a first-person stealth game set in a Soviet laboratory during the Cold War, players utilize spatial audio to navigate their surroundings. You, the lab's beloved experiment, notices some strange events and must escape, or else face death!
    <br />
    - I worked on the player interaction system, allowing players to hold, press, and tap on objects within a certain distance. I also worked on some artwork and visual scenes such as the audio test scene, opening scene, and logo. I worked on sound filtering with another member of my group.
